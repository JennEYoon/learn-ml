Many areas overlap 1st and 2nd ed.  May not need to buy 2nd ed for my learning purpose. 

### Setup and Environment  

  * June 10, 2020 -- installed VS Code for Unix on Ubuntu.  
    - VS Code uses conda "base" as default python environment.  
      Python v 3.8, plus most data science libraries including Tensorflow.  
      Also installed Jupyter notebook and console pkg.  
    - Installed Python extension, includes "Python Interactive" jupyter noteobok like cells.  
      Change default to FluentPy, when called from FluentPy/Exercises path.  
    - Each working folder have to select default python.  
      Deep-Learning path use "dlpy" conda env.  
  
  * June 10, 2020 -- exported conda env "fluentpy" to fluentpy.yml 
    - First conda deactivate, then conda activate fluentpy  
    - Then "code" to open VS Code on Ubuntu.  
  
  * June 17, 2020 1:30 AM - moved local repo to C:\python\repos\FluentPy\  
    - Google Drive backup not work well for Ubuntu "network" folder backup.  
    - Can still use all Ubuntu side programs from WSL Terminal, bash, conda-base, conda-fluentpy envs, VS Code Ubuntu, etc.  
    - git clone URL to re-download all files into C: drive. 

  * June 18, 2020 -- 
     To add -- links to MyBinder.org and Google CoLab for working online 
  * June 19-20 Move fluentpy repo to learn-mldl repo.  
     Merge with bistories was successful, but result not what I expected.  
     Added 1 commit to total history for learn-mldl repo and account total, graph.  
     Each file moved from fluentpy shows edit history separately.  
     - Keep fluentpy repo until several years later, when 2020 history graph does not matter.
