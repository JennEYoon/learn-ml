## More books:  

 * Juan Nunez-Iglesias et al., Elegant-Scipy  
   Best book for learning Python Scipy library. Authors are also core developers for Scikit-Image library.

   Github repo: https://github.com/elegant-scipy/elegant-scipy  

 * Aurelien Geron, Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow, 2nd ed. c 2019.  
   The 2nd edition has new chapters on deep learning.    
   Link: https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml2  
 
 * Shukla with Fricklas, Machine Learning with TensorFlow 
   First edition is worth getting. Has nice graphics and is meant for a beginner.   
   Second edition has all of 1st edition unmodified, and new chapters by a different author.  
   Not really sure what was the point of the new chapters as they are unrelated.
